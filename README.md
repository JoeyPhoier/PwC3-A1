Template for both visual studio and visual studio code

Currently is just the raylib template given to us, with an added makefile and .vscode settings folder.
This way, it can be opened on both VS and VScode without problems.
Only thing to keep in mind is that when it is compiled through the makefile, it creates an .exe, which debugging through VS does not.
