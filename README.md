# PwC3-A1
Template for both visual studio and visual studio code

Currently is just the raylib template given to us, with an added makefile and .vscode settings folder.
This way, it can be opened on both VS and VScode without problems.
Only thing to keep in mind is that when compiling through the makefile the .exe is created on the same folder as the makefile, whilst debugging with VS creates the .exe in "PwC3-A1/Build/Debug".

Would be cool to make either a metal slug clone or a gungeon clone :)
